         <p>Well, it's simple. Yesterday, I was coding. Let me walk you through my crazy coding day. Its all fun and fine 
             until you enter the life of a coder. I went through the 7 stages of coding. Please see the full list below.  
             Let's talk about each stage and your see how I ended up like this.

        <h3>The Good Morning</h3>
        <p>The Good Morning is when you wake up in the morning with a glow on your face beacuse you know 
            you are about to code. You grab your warm cup of coffe and head off to your computer. With a smile on your face, 
            you welcome the black screen with a hopfully gaze.

            <h3>The Uht Oh</h3>
            <p>Soon after Good Morning you may find yourself at the Uht Oh stage. This stage occurs when you are more likely 
                on a roll. When you start to feel invincible - thats when the Uht Oh comes along. You find a problem in your code. 
                This stage is still an okay stage. With time you know you can work your way out of it.

        <h3>I Got This</h3>
        <p>The I Got This stage is one of my favorites. This stage occurs after an Uht Oh period. You've used your skills to work through 
            what could have been a catastrophic problem in your program. During this stage,

            <h3>What The Hell</h3>
            <p>Don't get too happy because whats next is what nightmares are made of. This the worst stage. Here you have been through a little 
                trouble and worked your way through. You believed you know how to work through almost anything. But not this. You will rack your 
                brain trying all types of reasonable and crazy solutions but nothing will work! This my friend is the What The Hell stage. 
            </p>

            <h3>The Call A Friend</h3>
            <p>After you have tried everything you can possible think of you will then enter the Call a Friend Stage. Here you will call any friend, 
                family member, or person off the street that you remember talking about coding. All you care about it getting the help you need. You
                you may even be a little frustrated when said person does not answer their phone. The good thing about this stage is you noramlly are 
                able to work through the problem.

            <h3>The I Quit</h3>
            <p>The I quit phase, suprisingly comes out of the blue most times. Because you have previously been through all the emotions: happy, sad, panicked, 
                devasted; you would think nothing could phase you. But let another little hiccup come your way - thats when The I Quit stage happens. This stage 
                begins with a feeling of despondency. A little glitch happens in your program - that under normal circumstances you would figure out quickly - but 
                in this case it means war! I caution at this stage you need to move away from your device so as not to destroy it.

            <h3>The BreakThrough</h3>
            <p>Dont panick! If you make it through the I Quit stage with out tossing your computer to the other side of the room you can make it to the Break Through stage. 
                This stage is made of champions. All who make it to this stage are true coders! Koality Koders!!!!

    <p>So there's still the questions of how I ended up a hot mess. Well, I went through all those stages and came out a Koalty Koder but there are a few slight side effects. 
        Koality Koding can create nightmares, anxiety, sleepless night, and nervous conditions. BEWARE!!! For more information follow me on FaceBook. </p>
